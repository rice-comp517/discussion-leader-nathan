Paper Title: HYDRA: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System

## Summary
Carnegie Mellon Researchers discuss their efforts to develop a framework 
for an Operating System.

### Problem and why we care
Problem is coming up with the framework that is both flexible and easy 
to replicate. We should care because in doing so, because it allows us set
a base model for developing operating systems, from which we can analyze and
optimize components easily.
### Gap in current approaches
At the time the paper was written, the development of Operating Systems
was slow due to being an inherently methodical process, as well as there 
being no specific standard or template to work from. 

### Hypothesis, Key Idea, or Main Claim
The HYDRA's key Idea, as mentioned, is to come up with a system that
is flexible and replicable. 

### Method for Proving the Claim
In the paper are details on how the HYDRA
may potentially achieve this goal. These include, at the time,
notable rejections of various conventions, such as a hierarchal structure.

### Method for evaluating

### Contributions: what we take away
The HYDRA system is an interesting idea, though at the time of
publication, only an idea. It is difficult to say how effective 
its innovations are when there is little seen of it's actual
functiality

## Pros (3-6 bullets)
- Provides in-depth descriptions on the mentality of design choices
- Clearly lists out the goals and accomplishes them
- Focuses on each component of the system
## Cons (3-6 bullets)
- No actual attempt to implement the system
- Not much comparison to contemporaries
- No actual data to be had

### What is your analysis of the proposed?

In reading my paper, I noticed it was mostly a proposition,
as opposed to an actual methodical/iterative documentation.
The HYDRA concept only existed as a concept, and thus one could
not objectively comment on it's efficiency compared to it's 
potential contemporaries. That said, as a proposition it holds
up well as it backs up it's claims with sound knowledge of the 
components and functions and their intentions.

## Details Comments, Observations, Questions

Was there any actual implementation of the HYDRA afterwords? 
If not were any ideas from the HYDRA standardized in the industry?
A follow-up paper exploring this would be interesting.
